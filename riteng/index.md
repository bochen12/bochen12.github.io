# Worship

## I. The Entrance

*Prior to the service the church bells are rung three times. At the end of the third time, three times three strokes of the bell are heard, calling to prayer.*

### 1 Opening

*After the final nine strokes of the bell the service begins with the organist playing a prelude (the voluntary) or a biblical hymn or the choir singing, during which the pastor goas and stands before the altar.*

### 2 Introductory Prayer

*The introductory prayer is read by the cantor or the sexton or a member of the congregation. During this prayer the pastor kneels before the altar.*

Let us pray.
Lord, I have come into Your house
to hear what You will speak to me,
You, Lord,
Jesus Christ, my Saviour,
and Holy Spirit, my Comforter in life and death.
Lord, through Your Holy Spirit, and for the sake of Jesus Christ, open my heart
that I may learn from Your word
to grieve over my sins,
to believe in Jesus in life and death,
and daily increase in righteousness and holiness of life.
Grant this, O Lord, through Jesus Christ.
Amen.

*Or*

Let us pray.
Lord, I have come into Your house
to hear what You will speak to me.
Through Your Holy Spirit open my heart
that I may learn from Your word to repent of my sins,
to believe in Jesus Christ
and daily to be strengthened and upheld by this faith.
Amen.

### 3 Opening Hymn

*After the hymn (or after the introductory greeting) the responses of "Lord, have mercy upon us" (Kyrie) may be said or sung and the hymn of praise (Gloria) be sung.*

### 4 Greeting

*The pastor, facing the congregation, says or chants:*
The Lord be with you!
*The congregation answers:*
And with your spirit! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*or:* And also with you!

### 5 Introductory Collect

*The pastor continues:*
Let us pray.

*Here the Collect of the Day is said or chanted by the pastor, turning to face the altar.*

*The congregation answers:*
Amen.

## II The Liturgy of the Word

### 9 The Apostles' Creed

*All stand for the Creed, which is said or sung by the pastor and congregation in unison (or by the pastor only). The Creed may be introduced by the pastor with the following words: Let us profess our Christian faith. The pastor may also read the Creed from the pulpit after the sermon. When a baptism takes place during the service, the Creed may be omitted here.*

We renounce the devil and all his works and all his ways.
