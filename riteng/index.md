# Worship

## I. The Entrance

*Prior to the service the church bells are rung three times. At the end of the third time, three times three strokes of the bell are heard, calling to prayer.*

### 1 Opening

*After the final nine strokes of the bell the service begins with the organist playing a prelude (the voluntary) or a biblical hymn or the choir singing, during which the pastor goas and stands before the altar.*

### 2 Introductory Prayer

*The introductory prayer is read by the cantor or the sexton or a member of the congregation. During this prayer the pastor kneels before the altar.*

Let us pray.  
Lord, I have come into Your house  
to hear what You will speak to me,  
You, Lord,  
Jesus Christ, my Saviour,  
and Holy Spirit, my Comforter in life and death.  
Lord, through Your Holy Spirit, and for the sake of Jesus Christ, open my heart  
that I may learn from Your word  
to grieve over my sins,  
to believe in Jesus in life and death,  
and daily increase in righteousness and holiness of life.  
Grant this, O Lord, through Jesus Christ.  
Amen.

*Or*

Let us pray.  
Lord, I have come into Your house  
to hear what You will speak to me.  
Through Your Holy Spirit open my heart  
that I may learn from Your word to repent of my sins,  
to believe in Jesus Christ  
and daily to be strengthened and upheld by this faith.  
Amen.

### 3 Opening Hymn

*After the hymn (or after the introductory greeting) the responses of "Lord, have mercy upon us" (Kyrie) may be said or sung and the hymn of praise (Gloria) be sung.*

The Lord be with you!  
*The congregation answers:*  
And with your spirit! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*or:* And also with you!

### 5 Introductory Collect

Let us pray.

*Here the Collect of the Day is said or chanted by the pastor, turning to face the altar.*

Amen.
