Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!  
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!  
All ye who hear,  
Now to His temple draw near;  
Praise Him in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,  
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!  
Hast thou not seen  
How thy heart's wishes have been  
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee;  
Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.  
What need or grief  
Ever hath failed of relief?  
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;  
Surely His goodness and mercy shall daily attend thee.  
Ponder anew  
What the Almighty can do,  
If with His love He befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him!  
All that hath life and breath come now with praises before Him.  
Let the Amen  
Sound from His people again,  
Gladly for aye we adore Him.

Lord, our God, Your precious name and glory  
through the world shall sound in song and story;  
and every people in bondage yearning  
shall raise their voices, to You returning  
their praises.

God is God, though every land should vanish,  
God is God, though every man should perish;  
though generations like stardust streaming  
should fade away, heav'n with new life teeming  
is fruitful.

Highest hill to deepest dale shall tumble,  
earth and heavens shall to nothing crumble;  
though every fell-side and summit vanish,  
yet like the sunrise God shall establish  
His kingdom.

*Trans.: Edward Broadbridge 2009.*

### 11

Now thank we all our God,  
with heart and hands and voices,  
Who wondrous things has done,  
in Whom this world rejoices;  
Who from our mothers' arms  
has blessed us on our way  
with countless gifts of love,  
and still is ours today.

O may this bounteous God  
through all our life be near us,  
With ever joyful hearts  
and blesséd peace to cheer us;  
And keep us in His grace,  
and guide us when perplexed;  
And free us from all ills,  
in this world and the next!

All praise and thanks to God  
the Father now be given;  
The Son and Him Who reigns  
with Them in highest Heaven;  
The one eternal God,  
whom earth and Heaven adore;  
For thus it was, is now,  
and shall be evermore.

*Trans.: Catherine Winkworth 1856*

### 15

Rise up, all things that God has made,  
and to His name sing praises!  
The least in glory is arrayed,  
and with His might amazes!

Were all the kings on earth to show  
their greatest pomp and power,  
the smallest leaf they could not grow,  
nor graft it on a flower.

The smallest blade of grass or grain  
in wood and dale I ponder:  
From where should I the wisdom gain  
to name them with due wonder?

What shall I say each time I see  
the woods with life so swarming,  
the many birds all flying free  
for heav'n's delight performing?

What shall I say when, as I go  
mid meadow flowers swaying,
and countless birds sing out as though  
a thousand harps are playing?

Where shall I fasten my mind's eye,  
as over oceans skimming  
I peer below but only spy  
how many mounths come swimming?

How shall I praise the evening sky,  
the many stars there blinking,  
that gently smile into my eye  
while up to heaven winking?

What shall I say, when up I rise  
to God in spirit winging,  
where hosts of angels in the skies  
His heav'nly praise are singing?

What shall I say then? My own praise  
can never tell a story  
to match the wisdom of Your ways,  
Your kingdom, pow'r and glory.

Arise, all people, and create  
a song of joy resounding:  
Alleluiá, our God is great!  
Hear heav'n's Amen rebounding!

### 26

Nearer, my God, to Thee,  
Nearer to Thee!  
E'en though it be a cross  
that raiseth me.  
Still all my song shall be,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer to Thee!

Though like the wanderer,  
the sun goes down,  
dearkness be over me,  
my rest a stone.  
Yet in my dreams I'd be  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer to Thee!

There let the way appear,  
steps unto Heav'n;  
all that Thou sendest me,  
in mercy given;  
angels to beckon me  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer to Thee!

Then, with my waking thoughts  
bright with Thy praise,  
out of my stony griefs  
Bethel I'11 raise;  
so by my woes to be  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to The,  
nearer to Thee!

There in my Father's home,  
safe and at rest,  
there in my Saviour's love,  
perfectly blest;  
age after age to be  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer to Thee!

*Sarah Adams 1841.*  
*Henry Ussing 1881*

### 31

Your mercy, O God, fills the heavens above,  
Your fathfulness springs like a fountain,  
Your righteous hand with eternal love  
is stretched over city and mountain.

Your kindness, O God, is as heaven's embrace,  
Your judgements life's deepest foundation.  
All souls you save by Your wonderful grace,  
You heed the deep sigh of creation.

How precious, O God, is the mercy You shed,  
wherever Your children are living.  
In darkness the wing of Your love is outspread,  
we hide in the shade it is giving.

You quench in the desert our soul-searing thirst,  
You rescue the dove when forsaken.  
In You for ever our life is immersed,  
to light in Your light we awaken.
