Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!  
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!  
All ye who hear,  
Now to His temple draw near;  
Praise Him in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,  
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!  
Hast thou not seen  
How thy heart's wishes have been  
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee;  
Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.  
What need or grief  
Ever hath failed of relief?  
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;  
Surely His goodness and mercy shall daily attend thee.  
Ponder anew  
What the Almighty can do,  
If with His love He befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him!  
All that hath life and breath come now with praises before Him.  
Let the Amen  
Sound from His people again,  
Gladly for aye we adore Him.

Lord, our God, Your precious name and glory  
through the world shall sound in song and story;  
and every people in bondage yearning  
shall raise their voices, to You returning  
their praises.

God is God, though every land should vanish,  
God is God, though every man should perish;  
though generations like stardust streaming  
should fade away, heav'n with new life teeming  
is fruitful.

Highest hill to deepest dale shall tumble,  
earth and heavens shall to nothing crumble;  
though every fell-side and summit vanish,  
yet like the sunrise God shall establish  
His kingdom.

*Trans.: Edward Broadbridge 2009.*

### 11

Now thank we all our God,  
with heart and hands and voices,  
Who wondrous things has done,  
in Whom this world rejoices;  
Who from our mothers' arms  
has blessed us on our way  
with countless gifts of love,  
and still is ours today.

O may this bounteous God  
through all our life be near us,  
With ever joyful hearts  
and blesséd peace to cheer us;  
And keep us in His grace,  
and guide us when perplexed;  
And free us from all ills,  
in this world and the next!

All praise and thanks to God  
the Father now be given;  
The Son and Him Who reigns  
with Them in highest Heaven;  
The one eternal God,  
whom earth and Heaven adore;  
For thus it was, is now,  
and shall be evermore.

*Trans.: Catherine Winkworth 1856*

### 15

Rise up, all things that God has made,  
and to His name sing praises!  
The least in glory is arrayed,  
and with His might amazes!

Were all the kings on earth to show  
their greatest pomp and power,  
the smallest leaf they could not grow,  
nor graft it on a flower.

The smallest blade of grass or grain  
in wood and dale I ponder:  
From where should I the wisdom gain  
to name them with due wonder?

What shall I say each time I see  
the woods with life so swarming,  
the many birds all flying free  
for heav'n's delight performing?

What shall I say when, as I go  
mid meadow flowers swaying,
and countless birds sing out as though  
a thousand harps are playing?

Where shall I fasten my mind's eye,  
as over oceans skimming  
I peer below but only spy  
how many mounths come swimming?

How shall I praise the evening sky,  
the many stars there blinking,  
that gently smile into my eye  
while up to heaven winking?

What shall I say, when up I rise  
to God in spirit winging,  
where hosts of angels in the skies  
His heav'nly praise are singing?

What shall I say then? My own praise  
can never tell a story  
to match the wisdom of Your ways,  
Your kingdom, pow'r and glory.

Arise, all people, and create  
a song of joy resounding:  
Alleluiá, our God is great!  
Hear heav'n's Amen rebounding!

### 26

Nearer, my God, to Thee,  
Nearer to Thee!  
E'en though it be a cross  
that raiseth me.  
Still all my song shall be,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer to Thee!

Though like the wanderer,  
the sun goes down,  
dearkness be over me,  
my rest a stone.  
Yet in my dreams I'd be  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer to Thee!

There let the way appear,  
steps unto Heav'n;  
all that Thou sendest me,  
in mercy given;  
angels to beckon me  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer to Thee!

Then, with my waking thoughts  
bright with Thy praise,  
out of my stony griefs  
Bethel I'11 raise;  
so by my woes to be  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to The,  
nearer to Thee!

There in my Father's home,  
safe and at rest,  
there in my Saviour's love,  
perfectly blest;  
age after age to be  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer, my God, to Thee,  
nearer to Thee!

*Sarah Adams 1841.*  
*Henry Ussing 1881*

Your mercy, O God, fills the heavens above,  
Your fathfulness springs like a fountain,  
Your righteous hand with eternal love  
is stretched over city and mountain.

Your kindness, O God, is as heaven's embrace,  
Your judgements life's deepest foundation.  
All souls you save by Your wonderful grace,  
You heed the deep sigh of creation.

How precious, O God, is the mercy You shed,  
wherever Your children are living.  
In darkness the wing of Your love is outspread,  
we hide in the shade it is giving.

You quench in the desert our soul-searing thirst,  
You rescue the dove when forsaken.  
In You for ever our life is immersed,  
to light in Your light we awaken.

*Trans.: Edward Broadbridge 2009.*

### 36

Entrust your ways and grieving  
to God who dwells on high,  
in His fond care believing,  
whose help is always night.  
He calms the stormy ocean  
and binds the restless wave;  
a pathway He will open,  
your foot from stumbling save.

Revere your Lord and Saviour,  
then nothing shall you need;  
regard His works with favour,  
if yours are to succeed.  
Your cares and self-made blindness  
no purpose can achieve,  
but through His loving-kindness  
all things you can receive.

With mercy never-ending  
You see our mortal plight,  
the harm and good attending  
our every day and night.  
Within Your vision single  
all happens by Your will,  
and all things intermingle  
Your purpose to fulfil.

Your ways with us are legion,  
all means are at Your call;  
You spread through every region  
Your light and grace to all;  
Your labours are unresting:  
Your step cannot be checked,  
when You to us come hasting  
to help and to direct.

Though Hell seeks to devour,  
to challenge and withstand,  
You treat with scorn its power  
and will not stay Your hand.  
When lightning heav'n traverses,  
who can Your pow'r contest?  
Or who make bold with curses  
on that which You have blessed?

So cast all care and sorrow  
upon His mighty aid,  
and take heart for the morrow,  
undaunted, undismayed.  
Do not in pride endeavour  
the future to foretell.  
Does God not rule for ever  
and order all things well?

Sadness and joyfulness travel together,  
fortune and hardship keep pace side by side;  
pleasure and trouble are two kinds of weather,  
sunshine and rainclouds alternately bide.  
Though earthly gold  
brings wealth untold.  
Heaven alone will true blessings unfold.

Kings may bear sceptres with diamonds unnumbered,  
but such regalia are not just show.  
Sceptres and crowns are by charges encumbered,  
thousandfold duties they cannot forego.  
Kings so possessed  
bear deep unrest.  
Heaven alone ensures mortals are blessed.

Fortune on earth is inconstantly flowing,  
all in their hearts can know sadness and woe.  
Within the breast on which jewels are glowing  
often a sadness or hatred can grow.  
Burdens have all,  
crushing or small.  
Heaven leaves no-one to sadness in thrall.

Wisdom and honour and earthly dominion,  
power and strength in the fresh bloom of youth;  
though they are valued in worldly opinion  
all shall decline and in time meet the truth.  
Earlthly allure  
is not secure.  
Heaven's salvation alone shall endure.

Sharpest are thorns beneath loveliest roses,  
fairest of flowers can poison and kill;  
under a rosy cheek false the heart's poses,  
fate is capricious, it changes at will!  
Wretched our state,  
bearing such weight.  
Heaven alone can our bliss recreate.

Fear shall give birth to a joy that is lasting,  
comfort be won from the hardest defeat;  
poverty robed in rich garments contrasting,  
weakness shall stand on teh firmest of feet,  
envy and doubt  
be put to rout.  
Heaven alone can bring all this about.

So let my lot and my fortune transpire  
just as my God and my Lord may decide;  
envy may vent all its spire and its ire,  
all earthly trickery I shall deride!  
Sadness shall die,  
joy multiply,  
flow'ring in Heaven's bright country on high!

*Trans.: Edward Broadbridge 2009.*

Lord Jesus Christ,  
my Saviour blessed,  
my sole and sure salvation;  
O stay with me,  
eternally,  
Your love shall be  
my hope and inspiration.

In my concern  
alone I turn  
to You, Lord, in my blindness;  
Be my relief  
in times of grief,  
on my belief  
pour down Your loving-kindness!

When sadness weighs,  
on You I gaze,  
my heart no longer saddens.  
What need I fear,  
when You are near?  
O Saviour dear,  
Your solace my heart gladdens!

My place shall be  
where You set me,  
there may I service render;  
I turn my face  
towards Your grace,  
in Your embrace  
I rest in mercy tender.

So by my side  
You will abide,  
and You will never leave me;  
you gave Your word,  
my call is heard,  
Your help conferred  
and nothing now shall grieve me.

Then help us, Lord,  
with one accord  
to live Your word; we are then  
by love impressed,  
for ever blessed,  
by Heav'n possessed  
Your joy to cherish, Amen!

Welcome, New Year of our Lord,  
you are welcome on earth!  
Christmas night, when our Saviour was born,  
then light split the darkness and brought the morn.  
We greet you, New Year, you are welcome here!

Welcome, New Year of our Lord,  
you are welcome on earth!  
Easter born, when He rose from the cave,  
then God's tree of life put down root in the grave.  
We greet you, New Year, you are welcome here!

Welcome, New Year of our Lord,  
you are welcome on earth!  
Pentecost saw God's Spirit descend,  
our weakness with heavenly power to befriend.  
We greet you, New Year, you are welcome here!

Welcome, New Year of our Lord,  
you are welcome on earth!  
Full of grace, may this year of the Lord  
bring joy to us daily in Christ restored.  
We greet you, New Year, you are welcome here!

Then the wilderness shall bloom  
like a rosy bower!  
Fragrant airs the year perfume  
with their healing power!  
Birds shall sing and water flow,  
Lebanon and Carmel glow,  
Sharon's twofold glory.

Weary hands in joy shall rise,  
trembling knees grow steady,  
trees long dead with leaf surprise,  
every eye be ready,  
courage shall be reinforced,  
restless blood more calmly course,  
fear and sorrow vanish!

See, He comes, Immanuel!  
Faith has found God's favour.  
Satan's power He shall expel,  
as his people's Saviour.  
He all debt aside has brushed,  
see, His Enemy is crushed!  
Double grace His people gain.

Sight is given to the blind:  
see, His touch amazes.  
Ears by deafness once confined  
now hear joyous praises!  
Like a hart the lame shall bound,  
they who stammered all confound,  
raising clear their voices.

Thus Isaiah prophesied  
in divine elation.  
Ages passed, the day arrived  
bright with God's salvation:  
David's son, who for our sake,  
seen and unseen, here will make  
Paradise of desert.

Praises to our high king swell,  
praises to His Spirit!  
They as one do all things well,  
heaven we inherit.  
Even those who give no ear  
standing at the grave shall hear,  
lips once dumb are shouting.

New year song, our hearts consume!  
May our gladness flower!  
Then the wilderness shall bloom  
like a rosy bower!  
Birds shall sing and water flow,  
Lebanon and Carmel glow,  
Sharon's two-fold glory!

A child is born in Bethlehem,  
rejoice therefore, Jerusalem!  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

A lowly virgin gave him birth,  
the royal son of God on earth.  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

And in a crib she laid the boy,  
God's angels sang with heav'nly joy:  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

And wise men from the East there were  
with gifts of incense, gold and myrrh.  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

Our lot no longer shall we mourn,  
a Saviour has to us been born.  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

God's children in our new estate  
shall Christmas keep at Heaven's gate.  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

On starry carpets hearts ablaze,  
we walk to church to sing his praise.  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

God's angels there with great delight  
shall teach us what they sang that night.  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

Like angels then we all shall be,  
God's gentle face we too shall see.  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

Our Saviour brother we adore,  
Praise be to Him for evermore!  
Alleluia, Alleluia!

Christmas has brought a message blessed,  
both old and young are excited.  
What angelsong once to earth expressed  
small children now sing united.  
Bright stands the Tree of Paradise  
with lights to banish all sadness;  
the child who looks up with shining eyes  
shall never forego that gladness.

Joy is our guest on earth this day,  
the little King of creation!  
Come, sparrow and dove, fly down and stay  
to join in our celebration.  
Dance on your mother's lap, dear child!  
a wondrous day has arisen:  
today He is born, our Saviour mild --  
the pathway to Paradise given.

Christ was a child like you and me,  
in Him God showed us His favour.  
The garden with angels flying free  
is opened again by our Saviour.  
Heaven's own King has come to birth,  
His Christmas joy to us bringing,  
embracing each child like soul on earth  
till we join the angels' singing!

Silent night, holy night,  
all is calm, all is bright,  
Round yon virgin Mother and Child,  
Holy infant so tender and mild,  
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night,  
Shepherds quake at thi sight.  
Glories stream from heaven afar,  
Heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia;  
Christ the Saviour is born.

Silent night, holy night,  
Son of God, love's pure light.  
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,  
With the dawn of redeeming grace,  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

Silent night, holy night,  
All is calm, all is bright,  
'Round yon virgin, Mother and Child  
Holy infant so tender and mild,  
Sleep in Heavenly peace.

Beautiful is the earth!  
Wonderful God's heaven!  
Lovely the path that we walk along!  
Souls on the pilgrim way  
through earthly kingdoms  
we go to Paradise with song.

Ages shall come to be,  
ages too shall roll by,  
generations succeed the last;  
yet shall the heav'nly sound  
never fall silent --  
the pilgrims' song is unsurpassed.

Angel choirs sang it  
first for watchful sherpherds,  
full from soul to soul that dawn:  
Peace over all the earth!  
People, rejoice and sing,  
to us is a Redeemer born!

Lovely is the midnight sky,  
Beautiful to see on high,  
where the golden stars are blinking,  
where they smile in concert winking  
us to join them up above.

In the depth of Christmas night  
all the stars were gleaming bright,  
but a sudden new star showing  
filled the vault of heaven glowing  
as a star-sun set on high.

When this star to soft and bright  
showed itself on Christmas night,  
ancient lore foretold the hour  
when a king of matchless power  
would be born upon this earth.

Wise men forthwith from the east  
followed where the light increased,  
to that king, there to adore Him,  
and their presents lay before Him,  
who was born that very hour.

Stopping where the star looked down,  
Bethlehem, King David's town,  
there they found no king in glory,  
only Mary with her story,  
rocking Jesus in her lap.

As it brought wise men who prayed  
to the Christ-child and the Maid,  
so we have a star beside us;  
if we let it shine to guide us;  
we shall come to Jesus Christ.

This bright star that shows the way  
and that never leads astray  
is the word He manifested,  
which His life with us attested,  
as a light our steps to guide.
