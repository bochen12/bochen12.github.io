Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!
All ye who hear,
Now to His temple draw near;
Praise Him in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who o’er all things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen
How thy heart’s wishes have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee;
Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.
What need or grief
Ever hath failed of relief?
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and mercy shall daily attend thee.
Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
If with His love He befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath come now with praises before Him.
Let the Amen
Sound from His people again,
Gladly for aye we adore Him.

*Joachim Neander 1679*

Lord, our God, Your precious name and glory
through the world shall sound in song and story;
and every people in bondage yearning
shall raise their voices, to You returning
their praises.

God is God, though every land should vanish,
God is God, though every man should perish;
though generations like stardust streaming
should fade away, heav’n with new life teeming
is fruitful.

Highest hill to deepest dale shall tumble,
earth and heavens shall to nothing crumble;
though every fell-side and summit vanish,
yet like the sunrise God shall establish
His kingdom.

*Petter Dass 1698*
*Gustav Jensen 1909*

### 11

Now thank we all our God,
with heart and hands and voices,
Who wondrous things has done,
in Whom this world rejoices;
Who from our mothers’ arms
has blessed us on our way
with countless gifts of love,
and still is ours today.

O may this bounteous God
through all our life be near us,
With ever joyful hearts
and blesséd peace to cheer us;
And keep us in His grace,
and guide us when perplexed;
And free us from all ills,
in this world and the next!

All praise and thanks to God
the Father now be given;
The Son and Him Who reigns
with Them in highest Heaven;
The one eternal God,
whom earth and Heaven adore;
For thus it was, is now,
and shall be evermore.

*Martin Rinckart c. 1630*
*Trans.: Catherine Winkworth 1856*

### 15

Rise up, all things that God has made,
and to His name sing praises!
The least in glory is arrayed,
and with His might amazes!

Were all the kings on earth to show
their greatest pomp and power,
the smallest leaf they could not grow,
nor graft it on a flower.

The smallest blade of grass or grain
in wood and dale I ponder:
From where should I the wisdom gain
to name them with due wonder?

What shall I say each time I see
the woods with life so swarming,
the many birds all flying free
for heav’n’s delight performing?

What shall I say when, as I go
mid meadow flowers swaying,
and countless birds sing out as though
a thousand harps are playing?

Where shall I fasten my mind’s eye,
as over oceans skimming
I peer below but only spy
how many mounths come swimming?

How shall I praise the evening sky,
the many stars there blinking,
that gently smile into my eye
while up to heaven winking?

What shall I say, when up I rise
to God in spirit winging,
where hosts of angels in the skies
His heav’nly praise are singing?

What shall I say then? My own praise
can never tell a story
to match the wisdom of Your ways,
Your kingdom, pow’r and glory.

Arise, all people, and create
a song of joy resounding:
Alleluiá, our God is great!
Hear heav’n’s Amen rebounding!

*Hans Adolph Brorson 1734*
*Trans.: Edward Broadbridge 2009*

<a id="26"></a>

### 26

Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
E’en though it be a cross
that raiseth me.
Still all my song shall be,
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer to Thee!

Though like the wanderer,
the sun goes down,
dearkness be over me,
my rest a stone.
Yet in my dreams I’d be
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer to Thee!

There let the way appear,
steps unto Heav’n;
all that Thou sendest me,
in mercy given;
angels to beckon me
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer to Thee!

Then, with my waking thoughts
bright with Thy praise,
out of my stony griefs
Bethel I’11 raise;
so by my woes to be
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer, my God, to The,
nearer to Thee!

There in my Father’s home,
safe and at rest,
there in my Saviour’s love,
perfectly blest;
age after age to be
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer to Thee!

*Sarah Adams 1841.*
*Henry Ussing 1881*

### 31

Your mercy, O God, fills the heavens above,
Your fathfulness springs like a fountain,
Your righteous hand with eternal love
is stretched over city and mountain.

Your kindness, O God, is as heaven’s embrace,
Your judgements life’s deepest foundation.
All souls you save by Your wonderful grace,
You heed the deep sigh of creation.

How precious, O God, is the mercy You shed,
wherever Your children are living.
In darkness the wing of Your love is outspread,
we hide in the shade it is giving.

You quench in the desert our soul-searing thirst,
You rescue the dove when forsaken.
In You for ever our life is immersed,
to light in Your light we awaken.

*B.S. Ingemann 1845*
*Trans.: Edward Broadbridge 2009*

<a id="36"></a>

### 36

Entrust your ways and grieving
to God who dwells on high,
in His fond care believing,
whose help is always night.
He calms the stormy ocean
and binds the restless wave;
a pathway He will open,
your foot from stumbling save.

Revere your Lord and Saviour,
then nothing shall you need;
regard His works with favour,
if yours are to succeed.
Your cares and self-made blindness
no purpose can achieve,
but through His loving-kindness
all things you can receive.

With mercy never-ending
You see our mortal plight,
the harm and good attending
our every day and night.
Within Your vision single
all happens by Your will,
and all things intermingle
Your purpose to fulfil.

Your ways with us are legion,
all means are at Your call;
You spread through every region
Your light and grace to all;
Your labours are unresting:
Your step cannot be checked,
when You to us come hasting
to help and to direct.

Though Hell seeks to devour,
to challenge and withstand,
You treat with scorn its power
and will not stay Your hand.
When lightning heav’n traverses,
who can Your pow’r contest?
Or who make bold with curses
on that which You have blessed?

So cast all care and sorrow
upon His mighty aid,
and take heart for the morrow,
undaunted, undismayed.
Do not in pride endeavour
the future to foretell.
Does God not rule for ever
and order all things well?

*Paul Gerhardt 1653*
*S.J. Stenersen 1826*

Sadness and joyfulness travel together,
fortune and hardship keep pace side by side;
pleasure and trouble are two kinds of weather,
sunshine and rainclouds alternately bide.
Though earthly gold
brings wealth untold.
Heaven alone will true blessings unfold.

Kings may bear sceptres with diamonds unnumbered,
but such regalia are not just show.
Sceptres and crowns are by charges encumbered,
thousandfold duties they cannot forego.
Kings so possessed
bear deep unrest.
Heaven alone ensures mortals are blessed.

Fortune on earth is inconstantly flowing,
all in their hearts can know sadness and woe.
Within the breast on which jewels are glowing
often a sadness or hatred can grow.
Burdens have all,
crushing or small.
Heaven leaves no-one to sadness in thrall.

Wisdom and honour and earthly dominion,
power and strength in the fresh bloom of youth;
though they are valued in worldly opinion
all shall decline and in time meet the truth.
Earlthly allure
is not secure.
Heaven’s salvation alone shall endure.

Sharpest are thorns beneath loveliest roses,
fairest of flowers can poison and kill;
under a rosy cheek false the heart’s poses,
fate is capricious, it changes at will!
Wretched our state,
bearing such weight.
Heaven alone can our bliss recreate.

Fear shall give birth to a joy that is lasting,
comfort be won from the hardest defeat;
poverty robed in rich garments contrasting,
weakness shall stand on teh firmest of feet,
envy and doubt
be put to rout.
Heaven alone can bring all this about.

So let my lot and my fortune transpire
just as my God and my Lord may decide;
envy may vent all its spire and its ire,
all earthly trickery I shall deride!
Sadness shall die,
joy multiply,
flow’ring in Heaven’s bright country on high!

*Thomas Kingo 1681*
*Trans.: Edward Broadbridge 2009*

### 52

Lord Jesus Christ,
my Saviour blessed,
my sole and sure salvation;
O stay with me,
eternally,
Your love shall be
my hope and inspiration.

In my concern
alone I turn
to You, Lord, in my blindness;
Be my relief
in times of grief,
on my belief
pour down Your loving-kindness!

When sadness weighs,
on You I gaze,
my heart no longer saddens.
What need I fear,
when You are near?
O Saviour dear,
Your solace my heart gladdens!

My place shall be
where You set me,
there may I service render;
I turn my face
towards Your grace,
in Your embrace
I rest in mercy tender.

So by my side
You will abide,
and You will never leave me;
you gave Your word,
my call is heard,
Your help conferred
and nothing now shall grieve me.

Then help us, Lord,
with one accord
to live Your word; we are then
by love impressed,
for ever blessed,
by Heav’n possessed
Your joy to cherish, Amen!

*Hans Christensen Sthen 1588*
*Fr. Hammerich 1850*

### 74

Welcome, New Year of our Lord,
you are welcome on earth!
Christmas night, when our Saviour was born,
then light split the darkness and brought the morn.
We greet you, New Year, you are welcome here!

Welcome, New Year of our Lord,
you are welcome on earth!
Easter born, when He rose from the cave,
then God’s tree of life put down root in the grave.
We greet you, New Year, you are welcome here!

Welcome, New Year of our Lord,
you are welcome on earth!
Pentecost saw God’s Spirit descend,
our weakness with heavenly power to befriend.
We greet you, New Year, you are welcome here!

Welcome, New Year of our Lord,
you are welcome on earth!
Full of grace, may this year of the Lord
bring joy to us daily in Christ restored.
We greet you, New Year, you are welcome here!

*Danish Advent hymn 1556*

### 78

Then the wilderness shall bloom
like a rosy bower!
Fragrant airs the year perfume
with their healing power!
Birds shall sing and water flow,
Lebanon and Carmel glow,
Sharon’s twofold glory.

Weary hands in joy shall rise,
trembling knees grow steady,
trees long dead with leaf surprise,
every eye be ready,
courage shall be reinforced,
restless blood more calmly course,
fear and sorrow vanish!

See, He comes, Immanuel!
Faith has found God’s favour.
Satan’s power He shall expel,
as his people’s Saviour.
He all debt aside has brushed,
see, His Enemy is crushed!
Double grace His people gain.

Sight is given to the blind:
see, His touch amazes.
Ears by deafness once confined
now hear joyous praises!
Like a hart the lame shall bound,
they who stammered all confound,
raising clear their voices.

Thus Isaiah prophesied
in divine elation.
Ages passed, the day arrived
bright with God’s salvation:
David’s son, who for our sake,
seen and unseen, here will make
Paradise of desert.

Praises to our high king swell,
praises to His Spirit!
They as one do all things well,
heaven we inherit.
Even those who give no ear
standing at the grave shall hear,
lips once dumb are shouting.

New year song, our hearts consume!
May our gladness flower!
Then the wilderness shall bloom
like a rosy bower!
Birds shall sing and water flow,
Lebanon and Carmel glow,
Sharon’s two-fold glory!

*N.F.S. Grundtvig 1837*

### 104

A child is born in Bethlehem,
rejoice therefore, Jerusalem!
Alleluia, Alleluia!

A lowly virgin gave him birth,
the royal son of God on earth.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

And in a crib she laid the boy,
God’s angels sang with heav’nly joy:
Alleluia, Alleluia!

And wise men from the East there were
with gifts of incense, gold and myrrh.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

Our lot no longer shall we mourn,
a Saviour has to us been born.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

God’s children in our new estate
shall Christmas keep at Heaven’s gate.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

On starry carpets hearts ablaze,
we walk to church to sing his praise.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

God’s angels there with great delight
shall teach us what they sang that night.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

Like angels then we all shall be,
God’s gentle face we too shall see.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

Our Saviour brother we adore,
Praise be to Him for evermore!
Alleluia, Alleluia!

### 119

Christmas has brought a message blessed,
both old and young are excited.
What angelsong once to earth expressed
small children now sing united.
Bright stands the Tree of Paradise
with lights to banish all sadness;
the child who looks up with shining eyes
shall never forego that gladness.

Joy is our guest on earth this day,
the little King of creation!
Come, sparrow and dove, fly down and stay
to join in our celebration.
Dance on your mother’s lap, dear child!
a wondrous day has arisen:
today He is born, our Saviour mild --
the pathway to Paradise given.

Christ was a child like you and me,
in Him God showed us His favour.
The garden with angels flying free
is opened again by our Saviour.
Heaven’s own King has come to birth,
His Christmas joy to us bringing,
embracing each child like soul on earth
till we join the angels’ singing!

### 120

Silent night, holy night,
all is calm, all is bright,
Round yon virgin Mother and Child,
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night,
Shepherds quake at thi sight.
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heav’nly hosts sing Alleluia;
Christ the Saviour is born.

Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love’s pure light.
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright,
’Round yon virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in Heavenly peace.

### 121

Beautiful is the earth!
Wonderful God’s heaven!
Lovely the path that we walk along!
Souls on the pilgrim way
through earthly kingdoms
we go to Paradise with song.

Ages shall come to be,
ages too shall roll by,
generations succeed the last;
yet shall the heav’nly sound
never fall silent --
the pilgrims’ song is unsurpassed.

Angel choirs sang it
first for watchful sherpherds,
full from soul to soul that dawn:
Peace over all the earth!
People, rejoice and sing,
to us is a Redeemer born!

*B.S. Ingemann 1850*
*Trans.: Edward Broadbridge 2009.*

### 136

Lovely is the midnight sky,
Beautiful to see on high,
where the golden stars are blinking,
where they smile in concert winking
us to join them up above.

In the depth of Christmas night
all the stars were gleaming bright,
but a sudden new star showing
filled the vault of heaven glowing
as a star-sun set on high.

When this star to soft and bright
showed itself on Christmas night,
ancient lore foretold the hour
when a king of matchless power
would be born upon this earth.

Wise men forthwith from the east
followed where the light increased,
to that king, there to adore Him,
and their presents lay before Him,
who was born that very hour.

Stopping where the star looked down,
Bethlehem, King David’s town,
there they found no king in glory,
only Mary with her story,
rocking Jesus in her lap.

As it brought wise men who prayed
to the Christ-child and the Maid,
so we have a star beside us;
if we let it shine to guide us;
we shall come to Jesus Christ.

This bright star that shows the way
and that never leads astray
is the word He manifested,
which His life with us attested,
as a light our steps to guide.

*N.F.S. Grundtvig 1810 & 1853*

### 192

Hail, our reconciling Saviour!
Crowned with thorns and yet none braver!
Grant me what my heart proposes:
I would bind a wreath of roses
and entwine it round Your cross.

What with God has so distressed You,
why our earthly dust possessed You,
that with us You chose to languish,
life redeeming through Your anguish,
giving of Yourself in full?

Fervent heart and loving-kindness
triumphed over human blindness;
giving You prefer to taking,
therefore paradise forsaking
in our place You chose the cross.

O the pain of sin unpardoned,
how my heart is cold and hardened!
Where among these stony mountains
can I find life-giving fountains
to requite Your love divine?

From Your body rent asunder
springs flowed out that called forth wonder,
overwhelming all beholders,
melting icebergs, splitting boulders,
washing hearts for ever clean.

So I pray, all pride forgoing,
that You in my veins set flowing
such a flood as splits a mountain,
melts an iceberg, fills a fountain:
wash my sins and guilt away!

As for me You once have striven,
may I love life in You given;
May my heart for You alone beat,
so my thoughts alone in You meet,
in whom all things coinhere.

Though I wither like a flower,
hand and heart surrender power,
I believe that at Your order,
I shall cross death’s final border:
You have paid my debt in full.

O the mystery and the favour
of Your Cross, my dearest Saviour!
In temptation stay beside me,
when my eyes dim, take me, guide me,
say: We go to Paradise!

Christ is risen from the dead
this Easter morning glowing red!
His people now in ev’ry place
with joyful song their Lord embrace:
Glory be to God in the highest!

Christ is risen from the grave
from shame and guilt our life to save!
His people now in ev’ry place
with joyful song their Lord embrace:
Glory be to God in the highest!

Christ is risen from the tomb;
we meet again in heaven’s room!
His people now in ev’ry place
with joyful song their Lord embrace:
Glory be to God in the highest!

Alleluiá!
Alleluiá! Alleluiá!
His people now in ev’ry place
with joyful song their Lord embrace:
Glory be to God in the highest!

### 224

Rise up, my soul, it is the dawn!
Let fear and sadness flee this morn,
Let all your cares as a mere mortal
recede as life comes from death’s portal!
O blesséd Easter morning hour
with joy in flow’r!

Now shattered are the gates of hell;
no longer can its power compel.
For He whom death thought to have taken
triumphant has the grave forsaken.
O blesséd Easter morning hour
with joy in flow’r!

Cease all your secret heartfelt sighs:
a red-rose dawn pervades the skies,
above those who in His safekeeping
lie under earth or ocean sleeping.
O blesséd Easter morning hour
with joy in flow’r!

Sing, Christians all, your breath employ!
Lift high your hearts in songs of joy!
Sing to the friend that you are meeting,
who from the dead draws near in greeting!
O blesséd Easter morning hour
with joy in flow’r!

Come, heart, with all the grief of death
that at the graveside tore each breath,
lay all before Him when you greet Him
alive, as from the grave you meet Him!
O blesséd Easter morning hour
with joy in flow’r!

God’s kingdom now is truly yours;
wait, heart, make just a little pause,
for death is vanquished by Christ’s merit,
and life eternal you inherit.
O blesséd Easter morning hour
with joy is flow’r!

### 236

Easter flow’r, now what on earth! --
in the garden of a peasant,
scentless, graceless, nothing worth --
who would want you for a present?
Who would choose you from the rest,
clasp you to a loving breast?
Would a song-bird sing your praises
here in Denmark’s woodland places?

Never in the summer air
will your fragrance waft and settle,
nor with rose-scent can compare
or the silver lily petal.
Winter storms and barren earth
witnessed your uncertain birth.
Only those who know your power
will rejoice to see you flower.

Easter flow’r, say, is it true?
Is our faith a mere pretending?
Can the grave be broken through?
Is there life at this life’s ending?
Did He rise, as runs the word?
Will His word again be heard?
Is the cast-off grave-cloth a story?
Did He rise in Easter glory?

If the dead can not arise,
meaningless are hopes of pardon.
Fading, each of us must die,
never gracing any garden.
Then forgotten under earth
we shall never know new birth,
nor like molten wax be taken
as God’s candle to awaken.

Easter flow’r, should one strong drop
from your golden cup refresh me,
there the wonder will not stop,
you will raise me, new enflesh me.
Morning song and cockcrow clear
in your golden cup I hear,
waking with the dead at the dawning
of a rose-red Easter morning.

Easter flow’r, you too know death!
Christ arose as day was dawning.
Each Good Friday’s dying breath
is a pledge of Easter morning.
What are seal or shield or sword
’gainst our valiant risen Lord?
These are chaff His breath sends flying,
who redeems us by His dying.

You set Yourself down in the lowest ones’ fate.
You set Yourself up ’gainst the harm of the great.
You set Yourself into the outsiders’ breath.
You set Yourself over the horror of death.

And therefore You speak to us now from a place
where no one can harm You or spit in your face;
You still share our lives and our sufferings too,
so no one has life more life-giving than You.

You fight in the world for our freedom and peace;
when others give up, Your resolve does not cease.
If any are helpless or lost, you stand by;
You beat in our hearts, when our love tends to die.

You send us to share in the lowest ones’ fate.
You set us to fight ’gainst the harm of the great.
You live in our innermost longing and praise,
may we live in You at the end of our days.

O Holy Spirit, let us pray
that You will bind us close in faith this day:
till the world has ended
guard the church You gave us
from all need and danger,
in Your mercy save us.
Spirit, hear our prayer!

O Holy Spirit, blesséd light,
illuminate us so we see alright
Jesus, God’s belovéd,
lead us to adore Him,
in His Father’s kingdom
there to stand before Him.
Spirit, hear our prayer!

O Loving Spirit from above,
infuse the church with Your eternal love,
so we gladly wander,
sister close to brother,
as God loves his children,
loving one another!
Spirit, hear our prayer!

O Paraclete, receive our prayer,
as children resting in their mother’s care,
in Your calming solace,
so our every sadness

everlasting gladness!

death itself defeated.
Paradise recovered,

The sun now shines in all its splendor,
the light of life in mercy tender;
It is the Whit-sunlily time,
our summer gentle and sublime;
and more than angels once foretold
awaits in Christ a harvest gold.

A nightingale in the woods is filling
the summer night with music thrilling,
so all the Master calls His own
may sleep in peace to that sweet tone,
may dream a dream of Paradise
and praise God’s glory when they rise.

The breath of heav’n new life conferring,
a homely breeze the treetops stirring,
these currents wafting through our skies
breathe God’s reopened Paradise;
the brook that murmurs at our feet
brings Eden’s living water sweet.

The Spirit comes with pow’r to stir us,
the Spirit speaks and works to spur us,
not of Itself but for our sake
so we of love and truth partake;
the Word made flesh to earth came down
and rose to heav’n to wear His crown.

Awake and let your amen thunder
to praise redemption’s greatest wonder!
Let ev’ry tongue on earth extol
thank-off’ring’s sacrificial bowl;
around the table of the Lord
rejoice, His church, with one accord!

In Jesus’ name with tongues afire
both Jews and Gentiles all conspire;
in Jesus’ sacrificial bowl
all mother-tongues melt in one whole.
In Jesus’ name to God they send
their alleluia without end!

Our God and Father, by Your power
Your kingdom’s rose is in full flower.
Like suns we rise and set, at one
in glory with Your only son;
for in exchange for human hearts
to us Your kingdom He imparts.

Spirit of all truth and love!
bond of earth to heav’n above
which alone You tighten;
grant new tongues to strong and weak,
hearts infused the truth to speak,
as Your flames enlighten!

In Your light the dark must flee,
shunned be all indecency
that would mock salvation;
truth as clear as brightest day
here among Your friends holds sway,
crowning love’s creation.

In the water we are blessed,
at the table we are guest
of Your mighty giving;
in each branch and twig You bear
fruit for Christ and in Him share:
He the true vine living.

To Your children You descend,
graciously each conscience mend,
purest joy creating;
till the day when they take flight
and before the God of light
robed in white stand waiting.

You who of Your “little flock”,
weak and shy, in fear and shock,
made a race of giants;
make us soldiers of the Lord
who dare swing the Spirit’s sword
in divine compliance.

As You see from high estate,
love of earthly things is great,
wild its flame is burning;
quench it with our tears contrite,
let us blaze with Spirit bright,
for Your kingdom yearning!

Left alone to our device
worldly things our hearts entice,
all our peace displacing.
Jesus, be our life and light;
with one Spirit us ignite,
unity embracing!

O life lived in Christ!
You grant to our hearts what the world never prized:
what faintly we glimpse ev’ry day, ev’ry hour,
yet lives deep within us, we feel it empow’r;
my land, says the Lord, is both heaven and earth,
where love has its birth.

How blesséd the breath
we draw in a country with no sting of death,
where all that was faded again is in bloom,
where all that was mortal ascends from the tomb,
where love shall unfold like the first flush of spring
and fresh flowers bring.

How blesséd the land
whose hour-glass flows neither with tears nor with sand,
where wing does not falter, where flow’r does not fail,
where joy shines with light clear as glass but not frail,
and God has already redeemed from despair
the snow-whitened hair!

O wonder-full faith:
our bridge swaying over the ocean’s dark face
from bleak realms of death to the warm shores of life,
defying the coastline where ice-floes are rife;
live lowly among us, it pleases You best,
our Lord and our Guest!

O hope light of wing:
God’s brother new-born in the baptismal spring.
O lend us Your feathers that we may fly free
on wings of the Spirit to rest ’cross the sea,
where sun everlasting gilds all the year round
salvation’s own ground.

O life-giving love,
calm source of the power that flows from above!
You fill with the generous words of our Lord
the chalice of blessing on God’s festal board.
O, be now our life-drink on earth and the sum
of all life to come!

O Spirit divine,
the life everlasting in love’s perfect sign!
O melt our cold heart with Your fire from above,
transfigure our nature with radiant love.
Then filled with such gladness of heart we shall thrive
in being alive!

A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing;
for still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and pow’r are great,
And armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not His equal.

Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God’s own choosing;
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabaoth, His name,
From age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

And though this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us;
The Prince of Darkness grim,
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow’rs,
No thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through Him who with us sideth:
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God’s truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever.

We welcome with joy this blesséd day
to us from the sea ascending;
may heavenly light direct our way,
our pleasure and worth extending!
As children of light may it be seen
through us that the night is ending!

How blesséd the hour our Lord was born,
that midnight of God’s preparing;
then light from the east annouced the dawn,
and rose-red the sky was flaring;
the daystar appeared, the whole world shone,
all light in this sun now sharing.

And even if all the trees could sing,
their branches with praise resounding,
they could not outdo the Lord our King,
His mercy all tongues confounding..
Eternally shines on old and young
the true light of life abounding.

As larks in the sky greet rose-red dawn,
our thanks be to God this morning,
for life that He gave from death reborn,
for light, all the darkness scorning;
so bless’d be each day in Jesus’ name
with beauty our lives adorning.

Go softly along, our festive day,
transfigured towards your ending,
so each God-delighting minute may
resemble the streams, which wending
through meadows their joyful homeward way
reach pastures of calm unending.

Like gold is the early morning sun
as day from the grave arises,
yet golden again when day is done,
and gently its kiss reprises;
then sparkles again the eye grown dim,
new blush on old cheek surprises.

And so may we reach our fatherland
where days are forever vernal;
there stands a castle so fair and grand
with halls full of joy supernal.
Then cheerfully may we there converse
with friends in Your light eternal.

That is why bells are now ringing!

Save us, O Lord, give us blessing and joy!
This day was worship created.
Let the world’s millions their voices employ

Let them exult in the Spirit,

bringing them comfort and freedom’s flame,

Visit us, Lord, with Your radiant grace,
where in Your church we assemble.
Garlands of praises You here shall embrace
as our hearts joyfully tremble.
Each feast gains joy through its sequel:
Easter and Whitsun from Christmas stem.
Our hidden faith born of joy in them
vainly would seek for their equal!

Through font and altar may we be so stirred,
tongues sanctified by Your blessing,
that what all hear is Your Spirit and Word

All my living wellsprings in You shall begin!
Thus resounded the voice from heaven,

“My Son, You are my belovèd kin!”

All my living wellsprings in You shall begin!
These are God’s tidings of mercy sharing
living water beyond comparing,
the Spirit that Jesus bore within.

All my living wellsprings in You shall begin!
This is God’s promise which we inherit

Full of wonder in Your presence standing;

Through Your work and through Your loving-kindness,
we are born anew to life in Jesus,
to an open life of faithful trusting.

And at time’s last bound’ry You are with us

Dear Lord, we come to church and find

Our name which You with water signed
shall never be deleted.

You gave Your kingdom as a gift,
when at the font You blessed us,
and promised You would heal the rift,
when waywardness possessed us.

We called You ‘Father’ when You chose
us children to believe You!
You said Your greatest joy is those
who like a child receive You!

And so Your children we became
who live in earth and heaven;
The least who here believes Your name
into Your hands is given.

Your living water in the font,
Your ‘yes’ to those neglected,
confirm that we shall never want,
and always are protected.

O Lord, to whom else should we turn?
By You we all are greeted!
The words we at the font once learned
are here again repeated.

Let ev’ry Christian man rejoice
and leap for joy with praises!
His spirits rise when with loud voice
a hymn to God he raises,
who is as good as He is strong,
in whose creation we belong,
redeemed by our dear Saviour.

I sat within the Devil’s sway,
condemned to death’s damnation;
my sins oppressed me night and day
with fear and tribulation.
Becoming ever more entwined,
I nowhere could salvation find,
in bondage to transgression.

The Devil was within me loose,
I had no means to tie him;
my deeds and virtue were no use,
I was to death led by him.
My enemy held me in thrall;
the wages of my sinful fall
were everlasting torment.

Then God took pity on my state
of grief and desolation:
with mercy mild from His estate
He chose to send salvation.
He turned His heart towards my plea
and as a father gave to me
His very dearest treasure.

To his belovéd son He said,
I will show them my favour;
My heart’s dear crown, my Spirit spread
on mortals as their Saviour.
Go, free them from the bonds of sin,
and vict’ry over death now win,
that they may live forever!

Obedient to His Father’s will,
born of a virgin Mother,
on earth His purpose to fulfil,
He has become my brother.
He wielded power by hidden deed,
shunned pomp, and bore all kind of need
to take the Devil captive.

He tells us, Come, the gift receive
of true life in the Spirit!
I died that all men might believe
and lasting life inherit;
Now I am yours and you are mine,
to you my home I will assign,
and we shall not be parted.

Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
help of the helpless, O abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings,
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea—
Come, Friend of sinners, and thus bide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears have no bitterness.
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

There is a path
that we all must tread unaided,
it leads to darkness,
an unknown twilight clime;
and none have ever
returned from those dark regions
with news of what lies
beyond the edge of time.

There is a man
who alone in loving-kindness
bore human suff’ring
and went into that night.
What none could carry
He carried for all others:
He entered darkness—
and darkness changed to light.

There is a law
which compared to death is stronger:
that loving-kindness
will triumph at the last;
and Christ instated
that law as universal.
Now grace will comfort
all those whose faith stands fast.

There is a path
that we never tread unaided
although it leads us
into an unknown clime;
for Christ is waiting
for us at death’s last bound’ry;
He is our life-tine

Bear us up in our confusion,

Let us take hold of Your promise:

faith in You who battle for us,
full of love, and at close quarters
fight all evil in this world.

Whether we should lose or triumph,

asleep in their Father’s safekeeping!
Come, angels, He said,
stand guard round the bed
wherever my children lie sleeping!

God’s fingers have signed you,
His cross has defined you
on brow and on breast
a child by Him blessed.
No devil shall harm His creation!
In baptism’s bowl
your heart and your soul
may rest in the hope of salvation.

Your hands fold together
an amen to gather
to our Saviour’s prayer,
in secret to share
the song which the angel host raises;
for that little word
in God’s ear when heard
the angels enfold with their praises.

They sing with such voices
that all earth rejoices:
a word of God’s Son
from earth has become
a prayer on the Spirit’s breath winging.
With His hidden care,
may God bless the prayer
from lowlands now joyously ringing.

Redeemed from all sinning
in baptism winning
their spirit’s rebirth,
they fought death on earth
and passed on to rest and salvation;
they sing loud and true
alleluias new,
while angels smile their admiration.

The child who is sleeping
in angels’ safekeeping
can rest safe and sound,
as manna drips down;
no doubt you will find it tomorrow.
So clear-eyed and bright,
bid now your goodnight
to doubt and to fear and to sorrow.

Dear child, sleep sweetly,
and rest now completely,
and murmur that name
whose grace you can claim,
salvation to earth guaranteeing.
Sing, Jesus is mine,
so fair and so fine,
the light and the life of my being!

I know a flow’r so sweet and fine,
its scent all hearts uplifting,
its juice is like the clearest wine,
a fragrance fine
of roses to us drifting.

This flow’r is Love, wherein God shows
His own artistic powers:
before the air its presence knows
unseen it grows
until it brightly flowers.

But here on earth this flow’r grows wild
except in Eden vernal;
for by life’s river there it grows
and from it flows
a scent that is eternal.

The bridal lamp of Jesus’ grace
will guide us through life’s story,
for Eden is in His embrace:
to that birthplace
the flow’r will come in glory.

So now with Jesus’ blessing crowned
this flow’r is here replanted:
where love is, there is holy ground,
and joy profound
to man and woman granted.

How two are one in true delight,
joined by love’s consummation,
will be revealed in heaven’s light,
that city bright
where love is the foundation.

How sweet to travel the road ahead
for two desiring to be together,
for joy is double when we are wed,
and sorrow’s stormwinds much lighter to weather.
How sweetly valid
to travel married,
when we are carried
on wings of love.

How great the comfort is here bestowed
when two as one are secure united;
and what which carries the heaviest load
is love’s heart-flame in two hearts ignited:
as one together
that none shall sever,
with yes for ever
from heart to heart.

How wonderful to entrust our love
to God in this our celebration,
whose boundless mercy flows from above
to this and to ev’ry generation..
In grateful pleasure
we cannot measure
how great the treasure
of God’s good grace.

When two at length must then parted be,
how sad the days are of grief and sighing;
but God be praised for the pledge that He
prepares a country for love undying.
How great the pleasure,
beyond all measure,
the greatest treasure
is endless love.

Each married couple whose love is blessed
in Jesus’ name at their festive wedding,
through all this life’s ebb and flow may rest
in Him, as wider His love is spreading.
He will inspire
their hearts’ desire,
to share the fire
of love, true love.

You alone can bless this union,
bind them close in lasting love.
May they never go astray,
Lord God, lead them both one way.

Man and woman, sing His praises,
see this wonder with you done,
as in love He gently raises
two and makes you ever one.
Love forgives and love reveres,
Love keeps hope and perseveres.

Now spring bursts forth in flowers
delighting in their grace,
foretelling summer hours
in sunshine’s warm embrace.
The hillsides wave with grasses
and all that lay forlorn with
each new day that passes
awakes as though reborn.

The meadows bloom all over,
the fields bear rows of grain,
green veg’tables and clover,
new leaf in wood and plain!
All these are to remind us
how bounteous is God’s cheer,
whose grace flows out to find us,
embracing all the year.

Hear how each bird rejoices
with each its different song;
shall we not raise our voices
and praise Him loud and long?
My soul, sing with a flourish
the tribute that we owe!
For He will gladly nourish
us on our path below.

O Jesus, Lord and Master,
Your warmth upon us send,
make chilly hearts beat faster,
be with us to the end!
Fill us with loving-kindness,
our hearts and minds expand,
avert all pain and blindness
with Your most gentle hand!

O rose in Sharon’s valley,
your beauty we extol;
with virtues passing tally
adorn my yearning soul!
In Zion’s fields enclose me,
my spirit look upon,
and make me like the rose-tree
that grows in Lebanon!

Bless each year’s harvest treasure,
make fertile all our land,
give bread in daily measure,
bless every sea and strand;
Your manna drips from heaven,
that Word beyond all worth,
and with Your sweet grace given
bless us, and bless our earth!

The scent of grass pervades the air
in meadows, fields and verges.
The wind bids dunes and soil prepare
for spring, as life emerges.
God’s sun makes whole
both heart and soul,
proclaims the land is growing
to summer warm and glowing.

Hear how the birds sing joyful strains
in every waking hour,
competing with their sweet refrains
to praise God’s primal power.
Each seed and shoot
deep down takes root,
and joy of life is given
as skylarks high in heaven.

See how the flowers are now displayed
in colours tinged and tender;
King Solomon in robes arrayed
cannot compare in splendour!
All beauty known,
all love here shown,
the smallest in their station,
Dear God, are Your creation.

Yes, summer comes by Your good grace,
all things on earth restoring;
but brightest shines Your Word’s embrace,
love’s mystery outpouring.
All flesh is grass,
all things must pass,
but when flow’rs dead are lying,
Your Word lives on undying.

Yes, Jesus Christ the Word is true,
new life through death bestowing—
an earth reborn, a heav’n made new,
a world all green and growing.
Come, Lord, again
and make it plain:
the day of Your descending
will summer bring unending.

You gave me, dear Father, a plot I could tread,
and call my own land by Your favour.
You gave me a task and enough daily bread,
and I am secure through the word I am fed,
which all people freely may savour.
Here You let me build,
with peace I am filled,
my joy in Your grace shall not waver.

Long-dead generations have left me this field
whose furrows I plough before sowing.
They cleared and they planted the land You revealed,
and sighing or singing they brought home the yield.
Dear Lord, I bow humbly, well-knowing
the crop I have grown
was always Your own.
My thoughts are to You ever flowing.

So teach me, O God, how to live as I can,
as freely as forest-birds cheeping,
give thanks for the rainfall that watered my land,
for sunshine and warmth as the summer days ran,
give praise for the harvest’s safe-keeping.
Where was our success
if You did not bless?
The harvest grows while we are sleeping.

So teach me, O God, how to do as You say,
to use ev’ry gift I am given,
with honest employment to fill ev’ry day,
and help and protect those who fall by the way,
to love, for therein is life’s leaven.
And give me at last
when this life is past
a name in Your lifebook in heaven!

The forest leaves are fading fast,
and birdsong now is rarer;
the swallow flees the stormy blast,
the stork seeks climates fairer.

Where fields once waved with golden corn,
fair ears to ripeness straining,
there stubble lies, bereaved, forlorn,
mere barren soil remaining.

But in our barn, upon our floor,
God’s gift for all our sowing,
our enterprise yields up its store
of harvest overflowing.

And He who made it grow on earth,
the golden ears unveiling,
will live with us and share His Word,
the gospel never-failing.

We thank Him now with joyful song
for all that He has given;
for fields that grew all summer long,
for word and life from heaven.

Through all the year on ev’rything
He breathes his peace eternal;
and after winter comes the spring,
then summer, corn and kernel.

And when life’s hour-glass runs dry,
His word to us is spoken:
in Paradise will God on high
grant summer sun unbroken.

There shall we reap as birds do here,
who neither plough nor scatter;
and there be free of toil and fear,
and strife of earthly matters.

For harvest here and harvest there,
to God be praise and glory,
who shows through Christ, our Saviour fair,
the Father’s loving story.

His Spirit, who does all things well,
through life’s short days precedes us:
in faith and hope and love we dwell,
as He to heaven leads us.

Far in the east the morning sun ascending
upon the rocks and hills his gold is bending;
be glad, my soul, lift high your voice in singing,
and let your praises flow
in thanks from earth below
to heaven winging!

As countless grains of sand is His devotion,
His mercy runs far deeper than the ocean,
and each day on my head He pours his favour;
each morning in my cup
His mercy I may sup
and sweetly savour.

This night His angels have my home surrounded,
secured from danger by His love unbounded;
in fear of peril I no longer languish,
for I am free and saved,
no more to death enslaved,
nor grief and anguish.

My soul, be of good cheer, let sorrow vanish!
Your body’s living sap God will replenish.
I in my call and state praise His creation;
And by His strength restored
I duly bring the Lord
my adoration.

So may God take my hand and with the fire
of His good Holy Spirit me inspire!
Confer, Lord God, your grace on my confessing!
May I in Your decree
and in my industry
find daily blessing.

Let no sin bring about my total blindness,
may I be mindful of God’s loving-kindness!
But should my path today find sin prevailing,
O God, show me the right
and do not judge on sight
my frequent failing!

You know my wants and needs, awake or sleeping,
and fortune’s path lies also in Your keeping;
You know how best my service can reflect You.
You know my every task.
My soul, you need not ask:
Let God direct you!

Angel of God’s radiant light
opens heaven’s portals.
All the shadows of the night
flee when God’s bright angel shines on mortals.

See the sun move round the world,
light of God’s devotion,
messenger with wings unfurled
treading golden clouds in heaven’s ocean.

Over earth the angel plays
light from heav’nly places;
in his cape of flowering rays
all the madding crowds his love embraces.

Hall or hovel, yet the sun
into each is peeping;
great and small to him are one,
kissing children in their cradles sleeping.

He will also us embrace,
angel with light gleaming;
showing us his smiling face,
angel with God’s heav’nly radiance streaming.

Love divine our Father dear
on us all dispenses:
in each sunbeam God is near
and our joyful morning-song He senses.

The sun is rising in the east:
it spreads a golden tide
across the sea and mountain-crest,
on town and countryside.

It comes to us from that fair strand
of Eden in the East,
brings life and joy through all the land
to greatest and to least.

It greets us as when from Your hand
its primal radiance glowed
upon the tree in Eden’s land
where living water flowed.

It greets us from the home of light,
where God’s great star appeared
and over Bethlehem shone bright,
by Eastern kings revered.

And on the earth God’s sun yet pours
that heav’nly beam which shows
in Paradise on distant shores
the tree of life still grows.

And as the sun moves over earth
in awe the stars bow down,
reminded of a starlit birth
in David’s little town.

O Sun of suns from Bethlehem,
our praises fill the skies
for all the rays of light which stem
from Your sweet Paradise!

Now all the pretty flowers to one another peep,
in morning chorus cheerful birds are calling;
the children of the earth are awaking from sleep,
with home on his back the snail is crawling.

Our God and our Creator cares for the smallest worms,
the birds and lilies rest in His safekeeping;
but most for human children His love He affirms,
God breathes on their eyes when they are weeping.

God’s Son was once a child, in a cradle lay the boy—
a manger in a stable would suffice!
He promised all His children God’s heavenly joy
and sweet flowers from His fields in Paradise.

God’s Son holds us so dear, He is friend to us from birth,
to God He bears all children for salvation;
He mastered stormy seas when He lived here on earth,
gave children his playful affirmation.

And You who bless us all and the little ones embrace,
in Paradise one morning we shall see You;
You taught us how to lift up our eyes to God’s face,
to You, Lord, all praises are for ever due!

See the sun arise from the ocean’s flow,
all the air and waves are on fire, aglow;
though the earth is silent, what praise unfurled,
as the day alights on the shore of the world!

I will draw the air in with deep delight,
sing the Lord a song for the radiant light,
thank Him that the morning can so begin,
that the day enchants despite death and sin.

Thank Him that I may His great works extol,
and can feel the morning in flesh and soul.
Gloom and darkness flee with the rising sun,
when I say quite simply, Your will be done!

O that I dare hold you, a day so bright,
call you by your names, my soul’s true delight,
all those treasured names I alone know best:
Mother, sister, precious: my love most blessed!

Wave on wave of light into heaven leads,
to that very source whence the wind proceeds,
blown as if that wind by the light were shod—
O You gentle Father, my Maker, God!

Let me now but ride on the dark night wave,
let me now but travel towards my grave:
see, the God of life who once gave me breath
plucks me with His hand from the web of death.

When the sun again rises from the sea,
then forever will death’s dark shadows flee.
O the jubilation, the victory thrill:
on the shores of life see the light stand still!

The moon is slowly climbing,
the ev’ning star is shining
against the heavens’ glow;
our wood is hushed and resting,
and tufts of mist are cresting
the ev’ning meadows here below.

How gently earth is resting,
and, veiled in twilight, nestling
in summer warmth so deep,
as in a quiet chamber,
wherein all daily clamour
is soon forgotten, lost in sleep.

Observe the half-moon glowing,
the other side not showing,
though it be round and wide;
so too in human questions
we cast ofof wise suggestions,
because one half we have denied.

We mortals, so conceited,
like Adam are defeated,
and much we do not know;
the shadows we are chasing,
the artifice embracing,
obscure the way that we should go.

O Father, give me learning,
the talent of discerning
the truth from its facade.
While still on earth I wander,
grant I may child-like ponder
all things with simple, pure regard!

The cold night winds are sighing
my eyes know day is dying,
O God, bring peace anew!
Guard me until the morrow,
send comfort in my sorrow,
and comfort my sick neighbour too!

Always dauntless when you tread
paths God has commended,
though you reach the goal ahead
when the world has ended!

Never fear the darkest hour:
stars your path will favour!
With the Lord’s Prayer in Your pow‘r
never shall you waver!

Fight for all that you hold dear,
die, if that be fitter!
Life is then not full of fear,
nor is death so bitter.

Heavy clouds draw through the skies
with the dark descending,
from the field the black crow flies,
homeward he is wending;
twilight spreads its shadows wide,
darkness fast approaches.
Loving God, with us abide,
as the night encroaches!

Stay with me, for without You
loneliness will drown me.
Stay with me, for without You
fear of dark surrounds me.
In Your Father-hand may I
sense Your presence boundless;
then the bonds of darkness fly,
and my fears are groundless!

Let me feel each time I see
life as desolation
that You, Father, stand by me
with Your consolation.
And when night within my breast
is my heart surrounding,
O then grant me ease and rest;
win me light abounding!

Come the day when death’s dark night
over me is sinking,
let me hear at morning-light
songs before all thinking:
birds that sing their morning-song
in midsummer gladness,
where the day is always long,
free from night and sadness?

Heavy clouds and silent rain
over earth are churning,
yet behind a window pane
see a watchlight burning.
You who ease our saddest breath,
all our sin forgiving,
be our light in darkest death,
Father of the living!

You who have lit all the stars in the heavens,
light in our darkness a faith that can burn.
You are our lamp over all you have given;
may we sleep sound till the new day returns.

Thanks for the day full of light that has ended,
gift of Your kindness in meeting our need.
Grant us forgiveness where we have offended,
whether in thought or in word or in deed!

Thanks for the moments our hearts filled with gladness,
each time You led us to know we are blessed.
Help us to bear every burden or sadness,
You alone know for our lives what is best.

Thanks for our helpers each time we succeeded,
when it was hard to know which way to seek.
Help us tomorrow to help those who need it,
meet us Yourself in the small and the weak!

You who have lit all the stars in the heavens,
fighting against the world’s darkness and sin,
You are the Father of all we are given,
light in the darkness which comes from within.
